# Unit-5-Project

This is an employee directory that uses Javascript and Jquery to view and organize employee information. 
The exceeds portion of the project includes the ability to search for users using their name, in real time, as well as sifting through each employee using 'prev' and 'next' buttons while the Modal is open. Additionally, the colors, text and backgrounds of the CSS have been modified.
